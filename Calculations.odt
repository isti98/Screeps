        ? Profitability of resource stations
Calculation:
Profitability of resource stations : 
ProfitRate
=
Income / Costs-1
Income
=
the Recharge Rate Of theResource
cost
=
(carryCreepsCost * numberOfCarries + miningCreepCost * numberOfMiners ) / creepLifetime
amount of CarryCreep needed 
=
RechargeRateOfResource /  averge resource which is carried by a creep per ticks
averge resource which is carried by a creep per ticks
=
= CarringCapacity / time spent to go to the source and back
time spent to go to the source and back
=
( sourceDistanceInTime * 2 ) / creepSpeed
amount of MinerCreep needed
=
RechargeRateOfResource / average Resource mined by a creep per ticks;
average Resource mined by a creep per ticks 
=
MiningSpeed * percentage Of LifeTime spent on mining 
percentage Of LifeTime spent on mining  
=
(lifeTime - sourceDistanceInTime / creepSpeed) / lifeTime
